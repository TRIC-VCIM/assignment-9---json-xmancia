# readme


This week you will be given starter code for this assignment, including a JSON object.

You will find a number input for employee number, a button called "Clock In" and a button called "View All".

The button Clock In should search for the employee number entered into the number input and add a property for clock-in that will be set to the current date/time (getting the current date/time is included in a comment in the code)

The button View All will display all employees and their properties on the page. I suggest you look at a card style layout, let me know if you have questions on how to implement this.
